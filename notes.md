    notes for website:
    section to margin/padding make the white space on the sides maybe a soft grey.... done
    maybe adjust padding around section text

    break between sections --> clippy some kind of angular break... maybe an image little bit of color break one angled off one direction between sections and the other break opposite the other color scheme maybe a crimson red or something of the same warmer tone with the greys in mind

    link icons in footer should have some hover effect-- get bigger, or 'lift' and/or change color
